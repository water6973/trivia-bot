    Class for a history trivia hot or cold golf game. In this game,
    we ask a question with a certain year in mind as an answer.

    The player starts at the year 0. They can use different
    clubs with a varying degree of ranges and accuracies, such as
    a putter that lands them to exactly the year they guess but only
    within a decade, or a driver that can move them up to a thousand
    years away, but plus or minus two hundred years.

    Each guess, the game tells them how "hot" or "cold" they are from
    the target; it also tells them where they using golf metaphors
    ("on the green", "on the fairway", etc).

    Each hole has a par, and some intervals are bunkers (the Black Death,
    World Wars, etc) that make it hard to get out of once you're in them.

    The game ends when the player reaches the target year, at which point
    they can choose to play again with a different question or to stop.
